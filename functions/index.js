/**
 * This file is automatically generated by Firebase CLI when you
 * initialize functions. It is required for functions deployment,
 * even if you don't have any functions yet. Remove any unused
 * imports or variables to avoid ESLint errors during deployment.
 */

// If you plan to use Firebase Functions, you would uncomment and import these:
// const { onRequest } = require("firebase-functions/v2/https");
// const logger = require("firebase-functions/logger");

// Example of a minimal, valid function that uses logger and onRequest
// Uncomment and customize when you are ready to deploy your first function:

/*
exports.helloWorld = onRequest((request, response) => {
  logger.info("Hello logs!", { structuredData: true });
  response.send("Hello from Firebase!");
});
*/

// No functions defined or exported, so no ESLint issues for now.
// Your hosting deployment should now proceed.
