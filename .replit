# .replit - Replit workspace configuration
# This file tells Replit how to set up and run your development environment.

# Specify Node.js version 22
modules = ["nodejs-22", "web", "python-3.12"] # Changed nodejs-20 to nodejs-22

# Commands to run on startup
# We want to:
# 1. Install netlify-cli globally (if not already)
# 2. Install project dependencies (npm install)
# 3. Run netlify dev as the main process
run = "npm install -g netlify-cli && npm install && netlify dev" # Changed from "npm run dev"

[nix]
channel = "stable-24_05"

[deployment]
# The deployment run command should also use netlify dev or a production build command
# For development in Replit, the 'run' command above handles starting.
# If you plan to deploy directly from Replit, this would need to change to 'npm run build'
# For now, let's keep it aligned with the dev setup for testing.
run = ["sh", "-c", "npm install -g netlify-cli && npm install && netlify dev"]
